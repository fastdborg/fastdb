# Native returned-I/O-error qualification

This is the finite P4 matrix for the Linux x64 production release, complementing
[process-exit recovery](recovery-io-evidence.md). It uses the public FastDB
frontend with real filesystem files and test-only synchronous `UnixIO` wrappers.
It does not change production I/O or upstream core.

## Checklist

- [x] Inject four selected failures during WAL COMMIT and database checkpoint.
- [x] Observe COMMIT errors and exact failed-checkpoint result status.
- [x] Require atomic old/new document, relational and V2-index state on reopen.
- [x] Require acknowledged COMMIT data after every checkpoint failure.
- [x] Require rollback, subsequent committed indexed writes, successful checkpoint
  and another reopen after each failure.
- [x] Run focused recovery tests and FastDB package linting.

## Fault boundary and fixture

The eight cases cross COMMIT/checkpoint with:

| Failure | Deterministic injection |
|---|---|
| ENOSPC | Return the Linux disk-full error before a selected write |
| EIO | Return the Linux I/O error before a selected write |
| Partial write followed by failure | Write half of a selected buffer to the real file, then return `UnexpectedEof` |
| Failed sync | Return EIO before the selected real `fsync` call |

COMMIT failures target the WAL; checkpoint failures target the main database.
Write failures leave the WAL header intact and select the first frame write.
The partial-write case also passes the small frame header before writing half
of the page payload.
The partial-write case models the native backend's positive write progress
followed by a zero-progress syscall. `UnixIO` retries positive short writes and
returns `UnexpectedEof` on zero progress; a backend that falsely reports a full
write after writing only a prefix is outside this test. This does not inject
kernel syscalls into `UnixIO` itself.

Each fixture includes a collection, a unique scalar index, FTS, a two-dimensional
L2 ANN index, a spatial index, and a relational events table. One transaction
changes the document's scalar, text, vector and point values plus the relational
event marker. FTS queries require exactly the current token and no previous
token; ANN nearest-neighbor and spatial queries must match the same transaction
state. Collection integrity and native `integrity_check` must pass.

The fault is armed after staging the transaction for COMMIT, or after a successful
COMMIT for checkpoint. Each child must reach its selected fault, return the
expected public failure and exit with status 74. The parent imposes a 45-second
child deadline. The child exits without destructors, preventing close/drop from
retrying the failed operation before the parent inspects the persisted files.
The recovery boundary is a new owning process/connection after a storage error;
this does not qualify continuing arbitrary work on the damaged connection.

## Failure reporting and commit ambiguity

A failed COMMIT is not proof of rollback. In this matrix, ENOSPC, EIO and the
partial-write error recover the complete old transaction. A failed WAL sync
recovers the complete new transaction: its commit frame reached the file before
sync reported failure. An application must resolve the outcome using an
application transaction/idempotency marker before retrying non-idempotent work.
These outcomes concern process restart with the OS still running, not durability
after machine power loss.

The pinned core's `op_checkpoint` handles **every** pager error by returning a
PRAGMA row with `busy=1`, `log=NULL`, `checkpointed=NULL`. Thus an I/O failure does
not throw through the query API and its original errno is not exposed. This is
a diagnostic limitation of the pinned implementation. The test requires that
exact failed status; it never accepts query completion as checkpoint success.
Applications must check the first result column is zero. Later successful
TRUNCATE checkpointing must return `[0,0,0]` in this fixture. No new core exception
is introduced for this reporting behavior.

## Acceptance and scope

`cargo test --locked -p fastdb --lib recovery_io:: -- --nocapture` passes:
four tests, including the eight returned-failure children and the four existing
abrupt-exit children, in 7.31 seconds. All eight cases satisfy the document/index,
relational-event, integrity, rollback, subsequent-write, successful-checkpoint
and second-reopen assertions. The raw log is
`/tmp/fastdb-v21-returned-io.log`.

| Failure | Failed COMMIT recovery | Failed checkpoint recovery |
|---|---|---|
| ENOSPC | Complete old transaction | Complete acknowledged transaction |
| EIO | Complete old transaction | Complete acknowledged transaction |
| Partial page write + error | Complete old transaction | Complete acknowledged transaction |
| Sync EIO | Complete new, unacknowledged transaction | Complete acknowledged transaction |

`cargo fmt -p fastdb -- --check` and
`cargo clippy --locked -p fastdb --all-targets --no-deps -- -D warnings` pass.
Clippy completed in 25.56 seconds; log:
`/tmp/fastdb-v21-native-io-clippy.log`. These are scoped local checks; combined
release checks and exact-artifact qualification remain separate gates.

This matrix covers returned errors at one selected write/sync point per phase,
including indexed data maintenance. It does not establish every possible page
boundary, actual disk exhaustion, arbitrary torn sectors, controller cache
behavior, power loss, index-build DDL failures, every filesystem, or multiprocess
writers. Existing process-exit, transaction/index rollback and V1/V2 upgrade and
restore tests supply separate complementary evidence.
