# V2 standalone Rust consumer qualification

## Native-only refresh (2026-09-25)

After browser removal and the WASI core revert, the standalone consumer passed
again with the approved native scalar-error and FTS/WAL fixes integrated. Both
V1 and V2 fixtures passed; 341 registry/git identities matched the current
workspace lockfile. Log: `/tmp/fastdb-native-only-rust-consumer.log`.
Current lock SHA-256:
`eccecb92bd14841e0f0980680eb051f365db9454cbade2212a8ffdd80d3c6443`.
This remains a local Linux development build, not crates.io qualification.
The earlier record below retains its original source and artifact scope.

## Earlier qualification

Working-tree qualification, 2026-09-25, based on core commit `12109384a` and the
active V2 frontend. A private application outside the Turso workspace builds and
runs successfully with only a path dependency on the FastDB frontend.

`fastdb/scripts/check-rust-client.py` creates a separate temporary Cargo workspace,
seeds its lockfile from the repository, and rejects registry/git identity or
checksum drift. Metadata resolution and the executable build run offline. The
script removes RUSTFLAGS, CARGO_ENCODED_RUSTFLAGS and CARGO_BUILD_RUSTFLAGS; the
consumer directory does not inherit this checkout's Cargo configuration.

## Verified behavior

The extended fixture calls these public Rust APIs directly: `create_index`,
`define_relation`, `create_spatial_index`, `create_fulltext_index`,
`create_vector_index`, `search_vectors`, `create_function`, `drop_relation` and
`drop_function`. It uses FastQL to exercise each search source, record brace
projection with forward fetch, inverse expansion, H3 and a successful stored
JavaScript scalar. Typed record IDs and maximum int64 survive the result paths.

Indexed updates are rolled back before closing; a fresh Database/Connection
reopens the file and sees the original full-text/vector/spatial hits, relation,
projection and function definition. Function/relation removal and FTS teardown
run inside a transaction, physical integrity passes after teardown, and rollback
restores the function and full-text search. Collection integrity also passes.

The existing standalone V1 fixture remains in the same run: typed and portable
values, CHECK/unique validation, transaction observations, all five vector
constructors, profiles/audits, result and write-buffer limits, cancellation and
deadlines, correlated iterator CTEs, write-conflict policies and reopen.
Both fixture success messages are present and the process exits zero.

This does not cover the pending scalar-error transaction failures, qualify browser
FTS, or establish crates.io packaging. The frontend package remains private with
baseline 1.0.0 metadata. The broader V2 release gates stay open.

## Build identity and reproduction

Rust 1.88.0, dev profile with debug assertions, Linux x86_64 / Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS
under WSL2. C/C++ dependency compilation and linking succeed without caller
Rust flag overrides. The complete compile took 4m 26s; this is a build observation,
not a query-performance benchmark. **346 registry/git package identities** in the
resolved consumer lockfile are a subset of the pinned baseline; this count is
not a linked-component inventory.

The temporary consumer sources, lockfile and database were removed after success;
this cached executable is a test artifact, not a distribution build.
Python syntax compilation and Git whitespace checks also pass.
