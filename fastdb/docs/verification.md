# Local foundation verification — 2026-09-06

- Upstream base: `046e9cbf67d22491e8ecc941ec2891b02a9f3cad` (v0.7.2).
- Development branch: `feat/embedded-foundation`.
- Platform: Linux x86_64; Rust 1.88.0; default turso_core features.
- Cargo.lock SHA-256: `a38e8a443a0f8e2e87a20246e6064062c13822c6f68530fd76d711019fb1f4c0`.
- `fastdb/scripts/check.sh`: passed scoped formatting, Clippy `--all-targets --no-deps -- -D warnings`, and 11 tests (7 persistence/recovery harness tests including the subprocess helper, 1 differential SQL test, 3 parser tests).
- Differential harness runs 14 sequential relational SQL probes against the raw pinned engine and FastDB, comparing column names and typed rows. It is compact smoke coverage, not the final SQL compatibility matrix.
- Recovery harness exits a child process without dropping its connection after a committed indexed document and uncommitted changes. Reopen preserves the committed record/index and discards uncommitted changes. Mid-commit/checkpoint fault injection remains untested.
- All 34 archived inherited workflows match their upstream bytes. Only fastdb-ci.yml remains in the executable workflow directory.
- Upstream source changes are restricted to workspace member/lockfile wiring and workflow relocation; no core/parser/bindings/CLI implementation edits.

No remote CI result, platform packaging evidence, release benchmark, restore/upgrade rehearsal, or V1 completion is claimed.

CLI smoke: the 10-statement `fastdb/examples/persistent.fastql` example ran successfully through `cargo run --locked -p fastdb-cli -- :memory:`; all output lines parsed as JSON, no errors were returned, and the post-rollback SELECT returned Alice.

## Collection SELECT verification — 2026-09-06

`fastdb/scripts/check.sh` passed scoped formatting, Clippy with warnings denied, and all 16 tests after adding AST lowering and pure accessors. Five new real-engine tests cover typed/missing/null projections, nested and quoted field paths, boolean scalar predicates, record-ID predicates and numeric sorting, aliases and positional ORDER BY, pagination, document/document LEFT JOIN, mixed relational/document JOIN, typed bound filters, indexed transaction visibility, and protected internal names. EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN asserts a managed-index SEARCH for nested equality and a primary-key SEARCH for id equality. Existing differential SQL and recovery tests continue to pass.

Current Cargo.lock SHA-256: `bca7216de2f75f7f2cdfe7935f016ac82aa9b70c7bbe76ad6922aa91d2f42791`.

This does not validate unimplemented SQL-shaped writes, advanced collection expressions, concurrency races, or the complete V1 query contract. See status.md for remaining work.

## SQL-shaped writes and records — 2026-09-06

`fastdb/scripts/check.sh` passed formatting, Clippy with warnings denied, and all 23 tests. Seven new real-engine tests cover multirow column-list inserts; pre-update assignment semantics; multirow failure rollback inside an outer mixed transaction; typed object/boolean parameters; SQL-shaped validation and index maintenance; nested SET/UNSET and quoted-path distinctions; immutable and overlapping targets; fixed/dynamic record expressions and typed sorting; and numbered/anonymous parameter binding. The existing persistence, abrupt-exit recovery, SELECT/index-plan and differential SQL tests continue to pass.

A new differential probe confirms that this pinned engine rejects `$name::suffix` parameters and that FastDB preserves its exact error. This is an upstream syntax limitation, not permission to reinterpret namespace-like parameter text.

No upstream core/parser/bindings/CLI source modifications or dependency changes were needed. Full V1 write/expression/authorization and release gates remain open as listed in status.md.

CLI persistence smoke: built fastdb-cli with --locked; ran the nine-statement sql-writes.fastql example against a fresh file, verified rollback returned Alice, exited, reopened in a separate process, and queried the indexed city predicate to retrieve both committed names. All output parsed as JSON without errors.
