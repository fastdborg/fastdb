# Spatial upgrade checklist

Status: development on branch `feat/spatial-upgrade`. Nothing here is released.
Release number: not assigned. Contract: [spatial-upgrade.md](spatial-upgrade.md).

Unchecked items are future work. Internal prototypes do not establish a released
capability.

## S0. Freeze behavior and public API

- [x] Record the current release and spatial compatibility baseline: 2.4.0 is
  released; catalog version 6 is the newest; the released point contract is
  [v2-spatial.md](v2-spatial.md). Its stale development header is corrected.
- [x] Record the revision of the 2.2 general-geometry decision in FastQL.md,
  AGENTS.md and the [decision record](v2.2-decisions.md).
- [x] Freeze geometry types, topology rules, dateline rules and numeric model
  (contract sections 1 to 3).
- [x] Freeze function names, `ST_*` alias lowering, NULL behavior and error
  categories (contract section 4).
- [x] Freeze the H3 function additions, array limits and coverage map.
- [x] Freeze explicit bbox, polygon and nearest source signatures (contract section 6).
- [x] Define the ordinary SQL forms that receive automatic index planning (section 7).
- [x] Define input and execution limits with an initial cost assessment (sections 5 and 10).
- [x] Map the dating, driver, viewport and storm examples to planned tests (section 11).
- [x] Record the index migration and compatibility policy (section 8).
- [ ] Prototype nearest radius expansion in one snapshot and record round counts
  on dense and sparse fixtures. Moved to S1, because it needs the candidate index.
- [x] Prove that per-row prepared-geometry lookup does not re-parse: regions are
  cached by encoded bytes (contract section 5). A per-row timing proof on a large
  region remains with the S3 polygon benchmarks.

## Geometry layer delivered ahead of S2

The scalar geometry layer does not depend on the index choice, so it was built first.

- [x] Exact orientation with a floating-point filter and integer fallback
  (`frontend/src/spatial/exact.rs`).
- [x] Canonical Point, Polygon and MultiPolygon parsing, strict GeoJSON input with
  duplicate-key rejection, and GeoJSON output (`frontend/src/spatial/geometry.rs`).
- [x] Ring, hole, component, dateline and pole validation with a counted work limit.
- [x] Point location with exact boundary tests, half-open crossings and a
  latitude-strip edge index.
- [x] `geo::*` and `ST_*` functions through one table that drives the statement
  rewrite, display names, the SQL helper and the write-path evaluator.
- [x] H3 boundary, parent, children, disk, resolution, distance, area, compact and
  uncompact (`frontend/src/spatial/cells.rs`).
- [x] `search::near` accepts `ST_Point` and `ST_MakePoint` constructors.

Evidence, 2026-10-12, Rust 1.88.0 through `scripts/fastdb-heavy`:

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `cargo test --locked -p fastdb --lib spatial` | 22 passed |
| `cargo test --locked -p fastdb-tests --test spatial` | 16 passed, including all released spatial tests |
| `cargo clippy --locked -p fastdb -p fastdb-tests --all-targets --no-deps -- -D warnings` | clean |
| `cargo fmt -p fastdb -p fastdb-tests -- --check` | clean |

The full scoped milestone script result is recorded under S2.

## S1. Select and qualify the two-dimensional index design

- [x] Implement a bounded Morton/quadtree prototype under FastDB code
  (`frontend/src/spatial/morton.rs`): monotone 31-bit quantization, key ranges
  with a cover budget, region covers that pass crossing edges to child cells.
- [x] Assess a managed H3 prototype using the pinned dependency. Rejected; see
  [the evidence](spatial-upgrade-evidence.md#decision).
- [x] Compare both designs with the latitude baseline and exhaustive references:
  zero misses for every workload and query.
- [x] Prove conservative candidate coverage: monotone quantization, outward
  radius windows, seam columns, one-quantum widening for region cells; property
  tests in `morton.rs`.
- [x] Prove the nearest stopping rule (contract section 6) and record round counts.
- [x] Measure same-latitude, city, dateline, thin-polygon and distant-population workloads.
- [ ] Measure moving-point workloads (repeated driver movement with concurrent searches).
- [ ] Freeze numeric acceptance ceilings for the selective fixtures beside the benchmarks.
- [x] Select one primary design and document the decision.

## S2. Geometry layer and indexed viewport operation

- [x] Canonical geometry parsing, normalization and GeoJSON serialization.
- [x] Ring, hole, component and boundary tests.
- [x] Robust orientation and point-on-segment handling.
- [x] H3 functions with upstream reference fixtures.
- [x] Managed storage for the new format: Morton key, longitude and latitude per
  entry; `spatial` format marker; catalog version 7.
- [x] Atomic build, update, delete, rollback and reopen support through the common
  index paths; the released lifecycle tests pass on the new format.
- [x] `REINDEX` upgrade of latitude-format indexes, with a test that compares all
  four sources before and after.
- [x] Indexed `search::bbox`, including dateline, seam, zero-size and full-world viewports.
- [x] Profile fields for spatial ranges and nearest rounds (contract section 9).
- [x] Full FastDB scoped milestone checks, 2026-10-12, `fastdb/scripts/check.sh` through
  `scripts/fastdb-heavy`: shipping policy, formatting and warnings-denied Clippy for
  all nine FastDB packages; 1,078 Rust tests passed, 0 failed, 3 ignored (the opt-in
  measurements); Node suite 185 passed, 0 failed; C checks passed. One expectation
  changed: `metered_creates` now expects `USING COVERING INDEX` for a new spatial index.

## S3. Indexed radius and polygon searches

- [x] New-format radius searches use Morton ranges; latitude-format behavior unchanged.
- [x] Contains, Covers, Within and point/region Intersects.
- [x] `search::polygon` with prepared regions registered per statement.
- [x] Ordinary WHERE rewrites (contract section 7), keeping every original predicate.
- [x] NULL, invalid and non-constant arguments, aliases and parameters keep
  ordinary results; `NOT INDEXED` comparisons in `fastdb/tests/tests/spatial.rs`.
- [x] Indexed results equal exhaustive or scan evaluation in every test.
- [x] Plan choice (EXPLAIN) and no full scan asserted for selective fixtures.
- [x] Investigate the dense-city latency gap: fixed by a covering index ([evidence](spatial-upgrade-evidence.md#covering-index)).

## S4. Exact nearest search with filters

- [x] Complete radius expansion in one snapshot.
- [x] Eligibility applied before the `k` rows are chosen (ordinary form).
- [x] Availability, freshness and other AND filters on the collection.
- [x] Distance and typed-ID ties; `k` from 1 to 10,000.
- [x] `search::nearest` with the optional allowed-ID array, and the ordinary form.
- [x] Invalid explicit arguments rejected without scan fallback.
- [x] Sparse, fewer-than-k, tie, pending-write and rollback cases.
- [ ] Benchmark concurrent movement and search.

## S5 and S6

Not started: client qualification beyond the Rust and Node test suites, migration
interruption tests, old-binary rejection with the real 2.4.0 artifacts, user
documentation, release selection and qualification.

## Comparison with SurrealDB

- [x] Benchmark seven location workloads and single-driver updates against
  SurrealDB 3.3.0 with the RocksDB file backend, 100,000 documents, two datasets,
  identical results for every sample. See
  [the comparison](spatial-surrealdb-comparison.md) and
  `fastdb/scripts/bench-spatial-surreal.cjs`.
- [x] Fixes from the comparison: literal LIMIT in nearest statements, exact
  condition replacement, faster nearest probing with a global fallback, and a
  larger prepared-region cache.
- [ ] FastDB per-document evaluation, result conversion and write costs remain
  the main gap for large result sets, scans and updates (outside spatial scope).
