# V1 implementation status

V1 is incomplete. The full scope is the FastDB.md master plan in the parent planning directory. This file records current evidence and work remaining; no milestone substitutes for the full V1 goal.

## Repository and tooling

- Local Git checkout: `turso/`, branch `feat/embedded-foundation` (local `main` is the baseline), upstream v0.7.2 at `046e9cbf67d22491e8ecc941ec2891b02a9f3cad`.
- Four workspace crates: fastql-parser, fastdb, fastdb-cli, fastdb-tests. All product crates are unpublished 0.1.0 prototypes.
- Scoped script: `fastdb/scripts/check.sh`; one Ubuntu CI YAML, read-only permissions, timeout and cancellation. Inherited workflow files moved unchanged to `.github/upstream-workflows/`.
- Remote FastDB fork owner is unresolved. No origin remote, push, PR, branch protection, or hosted FastDB CI result exists yet.
- Local toolchain is installed under `/tmp/fastdb-cargo` and `/tmp/fastdb-rustup`. Run with PATH prefixed by `/tmp/fastdb-cargo/bin`, CARGO_HOME and RUSTUP_HOME set accordingly, and RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN=1.88.0. These temporary tools may need reinstalling on another machine/session.

## Implemented subset

- Bare collection CREATE TABLE, IF NOT EXISTS, fixed typed IDs, direct-record SELECT, object/DOCUMENT INSERT, target object UPDATE, target DELETE, RETURNING *.
- Nested objects/arrays, tagged persisted values, bool/int64/null/binary distinction, UUIDv7 automatic IDs.
- Field definitions (basic types, required/nullable, nested paths, overwrite) and single-path managed scalar/reference indexes with unique/nonunique variants. Rust APIs and initial FastQL declarations.
- Statement savepoints, transactional catalog/index maintenance, mixed ordinary SQL/document transactions.
- Rust query cardinality helpers and initial line-oriented stdin CLI with tagged JSON output.
- AST-lowered collection SELECT: typed field/document projections, scalar expressions, WHERE, explicit joins (including mixed relational/document joins), ORDER BY, LIMIT/OFFSET, named typed parameters, fixed record predicates, and EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN. Single-path equality filters on the leading collection use its managed index; id equality uses the physical primary-key index.
- SQL column-list VALUES inserts (including multiple rows), predicate-based multirow UPDATE/DELETE, nested SET/UNSET, and RETURNING *. Whole statements share a savepoint and evaluated candidates use pre-update values.
- SQL type::record constructors and typed record expression projections, including standalone SELECT; named and numbered/anonymous value binding through the Rust parameter map.
- Ordinary SQL delegation outside the conservative collection-name guard, which still protects unimplemented forms.

## Verification

The scoped test suite includes parser collision probes; persistent CRUD/reopen; mixed transaction rollback; failed unique inserts/updates/index builds; validation-definition rollback; typed round trips; numeric/index identity; a child process that exits without closing an active transaction; and differential ordinary SQL probes against the pinned engine. On 2026-09-06, `fastdb/scripts/check.sh` passed formatting, Clippy with warnings denied for the FastDB packages, and all 23 tests (including the subprocess helper, five collection SELECT tests, and seven SQL-shaped write/constructor tests). This is local Linux evidence; hosted CI has not run. The process-exit test is a basic recovery smoke, not interrupted-checkpoint or power-loss certification.

## Next implementation work

1. Complete the SQL-shaped write contract (INSERT SELECT, general RETURNING expressions, further supported statement forms) and replace the remaining conservative managed-name guard. Complete collection read cases: subqueries/CTEs, grouping/DISTINCT/window semantics, arbitrary-depth paths, compound/derived typed expressions, and broader index planning. Preserve baseline parameter/alias forms and ordinary SQL errors. The old fallback guard still rejects some harmless strings and is not a final compatibility/security boundary.
2. Finish expression type propagation and document-literal function calls; document functions, predicate-based object patches, UPSERT, CHECK, remove/drop/inspection, full index lifecycle, stable errors/results, cancellation and resource limits. Namespace collisions, metadata format validation, multi-connection schema races, and managed object dependency access need full coverage.
3. Add snapshot-consistent batched one-hop links, bundled bounded QuickJS functions, and verified exact upstream vectors. Vector bytes currently have no validated public constructor/field validator; do not advertise vector support yet.
4. Native Node/TypeScript client and complete Rust packaging; lossless cross-language wire encoding; CLI multiline/batch UX, import/export, migrations, schema/query-plan inspection.
5. Complete all master-plan/FastQL release gates: broad differential coverage, interrupted commits/checkpoints, restore/upgrade rehearsal, bounded crash/fuzz/stress, resource limits, benchmarks and platform packaging smoke tests. External pilots and business evidence are also not present.

Keep upstream implementation files unchanged. No cloud implementation or V2/V3 features have begun.

## SELECT lowering implementation notes

`frontend/src/select.rs` parses through the pinned SQLite AST and rewrites collection sources/field expressions. `frontend/src/functions.rs` registers static pure accessors on each private engine connection before exposing it. Scalar access rejects objects/arrays/vectors; typed projections decode the tagged value. Record ORDER BY uses canonical targets and signed integer ordering before string keys. Index candidates are selected only for simple equality/AND predicates with constant or bound keys, and the original predicate is retained for correctness. Other predicates remain engine-evaluated scans; no index use is claimed for them.

The current result metadata distinguishes direct typed field projections from ordinary SQL scalar expression results. Typed values flowing through arbitrary expressions, binary literals compared to typed binary fields, mixed record/scalar ordering, complete alias resolution, and metadata snapshot races still require work before V1 semantics can freeze. Unsupported DISTINCT/CTE/group/window/derived-table collection queries fail instead of being advertised as implemented. This does not reduce the master-plan scope.

## SQL-shaped write notes

`frontend/src/write.rs` dispatches parsed collection writes and delegates unchanged relational statements. `update.rs` normalizes collection path assignments before the stock SQL parser; paths preserve quoted segments, and duplicate/overlapping paths fail before mutation. Missing SET parents become objects; non-object parents fail. UNSET removes absent paths as a no-op and still validates the final document. Direct record SET/UNSET targets lower to an immutable-ID predicate. All candidate assignment values are collected before applying any row. Validation or uniqueness failures roll back the whole statement while retaining an existing outer transaction when the engine permits it.

Direct typed parameters and copied document fields retain their logical types. Ordinary SQL scalar expressions retain engine scalar types: SQL TRUE/FALSE become integer 1/0, so boolean validators require typed Boolean parameters or document literals rather than implicit coercion. The Rust map uses `?1`, `?2`, etc. to bind numbered or anonymous statement slots. Pinned Turso v0.7.2 rejects `$name::suffix`; a differential test preserves that exact engine error instead of reinterpreting it.

Current write limits include RETURNING * only, VALUES rather than INSERT SELECT, no UPDATE FROM/CTE/tuple assignments, and incomplete expression type propagation. The full V1 scope remains unchanged. Resource limits and catalog concurrency still need release-level verification.
